# Image Compression for Efficient Storage and Transmission

This project implements and compares two image compression techniques â€” JPEG (DCT-based) and JPEG2000-like (using Haar Wavelet Transform) â€” to explore efficient methods for image storage and transmission. The implementation supports both grayscale and RGB images, providing both visual outputs and quantitative evaluation using Compression Ratio, PSNR, and SSIM.

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

### 1. JPEG Compression (DCT-Based)
- Convert image to YCbCr (for RGB)
- Block-wise DCT transformation
- Quantization and zigzag scanning
- Entropy encoding (basic)

### 2. JPEG2000-like Compression (Haar Transform)
- Multi-level Haar Wavelet Decomposition
- Thresholding for compression
- Inverse Haar for reconstruction
